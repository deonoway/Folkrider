								<div class='contain'>
									A. Joining allows you to download all of the music the site will ever have for life for this one-time fee.
									 At our current rate thats over 20 hours of MP3s by the end of the year.
									 This makes Folkrider the easiest and least expensive way to support independent artists in the genre.

									A. Yes. Folkrider promotes only a small part of the artists catalogues in the site and

									Folkrider for CDs, products, or downloads.
