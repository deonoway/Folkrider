				<div class="answer"><div class="em">A:</div><p>Joining allows you to download all of the music we will ever have for life for the life of the site, and just for a one-time fee. At our current rate thats over 20 hours of MP3s by the end of the year. This makes Folkrider the easiest and least expensive way to support independent artists in the genre.</p></div>
